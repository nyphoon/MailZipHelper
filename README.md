# Mail Zip Helper

Import miltiple files from differrnt path easily. And create a zip file appended special extension name.
This would help someone whose office has the policy to filter executable attached file (eg: .exe .com). With this utility, user can drag-on-drop the file which to be attached. And just send the generated zip archive. Don't be annoyed at the mail policy.
